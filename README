Known issues: 
- need to specify file extension when making the final decoded file
- Table doesn't update when decode button is clicked
- Doens't allow the encoding of a file with only 1 character.

All of these issues I plan on fixing in the near future (hopedully before you see this), I just want to turn something in before the due date. Just ran out of time here, completely on me.
